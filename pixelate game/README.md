To get started:

at first use npm install
then to open browser use npm start
This will start a small http server, which will serve up the index.html file, as well as any "static resources" (that is, CSS and JS files, as well as fonts) that the index.html requests (via link and script tags). You can view the page by opening http://localhost:8080/ in your browser!

You can add your own CSS to style.css, and JavaScript to script.js! For further instruction, refer to the workshop. Have fun!

html file has the html that browser uses to make DOM
html file also has link and script tags that cause
the browser to request additional resources
